## Overview

Getting access to the Observability Platform is currently by invitation only.

Please reach out via [#ask-observability-platform](https://moj.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C05QXHR697S) to discuss your requirements.

## Onboarding

Once onboarding has been agreed with the Observability Platform team, you will need to provide the following information:

* Tenant name (e.g. `Observability Platform`)

* GitHub team (e.g. `observability-platform`)

* AWS accounts and whether

  * Amazon CloudWatch is enabled or disabled

  * Amazon X-Ray is enabled or disabled

  * Prometheus push is enabled or disabled

* Optionally any PagerDuty integrations keys

* Optionally any Slack channels

## Deploying Observability Platform Terraform Module

To access Amazon CloudWatch and X-Ray in your accoumt, the Observability Platform team have created a Terraform module to create the required resources.

Documentation for this module can be found on the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/ministryofjustice/observability-platform-tenant/aws/latest).

An example of using this module can be found below:

```hcl
module "observability_platform_tenant" {
  source  = "ministryofjustice/observability-platform-tenant/aws"
  version = "1.0.0"

  enable_xray                       = true
  observability_platform_account_id = local.environment_management.account_ids["observability-platform-production"]

  tags = local.tags
}
```

## Creating a PagerDuty Integration

Please refer to [PagerDuty's documentation](https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/ZG9jOjExMDI5NTgw-events-api-v2-overview#getting-started) for creating an `Events API v2` integration.

## Configuring Observability Platform's Slack Bot

To recieve alerts to a Slack channel, you will need to invite `@observabilityplatform`.
