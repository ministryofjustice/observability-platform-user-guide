## Overview

The Ministry of Justice's Observability Platform is a prototype service for applications that are running on
the [Ministry of Justice's Modernisation Platform](https://user-guide.modernisation-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/).

The Observability Platform provides a way for teams to:

* Visualise application logs and metrics in a single pane of glass

* Publish time series metrics to a central location

* Alert to PagerDuty and/or Slack based on signals from their logs and metrics

The Observability Platform team maintains the infrastructure, allowing teams to focus on running their applications.
