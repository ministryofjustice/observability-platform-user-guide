## Overview

Once you have finished [onboarding to Observability Platform](/getting-started/onboarding.html), you can access Grafana by using the [AWS access portal](https://moj.awsapps.com/start/#/?tab=applications).

## Using Grafana

As a tenant, you will have access to:

* Your onboarded AWS data sources

* Your onboarded PagerDuty integrations and/or Slack channels

* A GitHub data source

* A folder to create dashboards and alerts

For comprehensive documentation, please refer to [Grafana Labs' documentation site](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/v10.4/).
